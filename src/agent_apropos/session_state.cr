  # Per-session dedup store: the set of rule-file paths already
  # injected during a Claude Code session, so a rule is delivered at most once
  # per session. Persisted as pretty-printed JSON at
  # `.cache/agent-apropos/sessions/<session_id>.json` with an `updated_at` stamp
  # used to prune stale files opportunistically.
  #
  # Each injection also carries a `cause` — the layer, the hook event, the file
  # that triggered it, and the specific glob/regex pattern(s) that matched — so
  # the cache doubles as a debugging trail: reading the file answers "why did
  # this rule show up?" without re-deriving it from the index.
  #
  # All disk access goes through an injected `Filesystem`; the clock is injected
  # too (`now`), so persistence and pruning are unit-testable without real time.

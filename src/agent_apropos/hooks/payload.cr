    # same `file_path`/`content`/`new_string` argument names). Parsing is
    # deliberately *tolerant*: every field is optional, unknown keys are ignored,
    # and malformed JSON yields nil rather than raising — the hook path must fail
    # open, and the field names are the part of the contract most
    # exposed to upstream schema drift. The captured fixtures under
    # `spec/fixtures/hook_payloads/` — not this struct — are the authoritative
    # record of the field names; this parser just follows them.

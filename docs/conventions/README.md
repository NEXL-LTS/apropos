# Conventions — the Agent Documentation Structure Standard

This directory is the **single source of truth** for scoped guidance — the
judgment calls and directional practices that a linter or formatter cannot
enforce. It is also the normative definition of the layered documentation
structure apropos implements; apropos dogfoods that structure on itself here.

Universal, always-apply rules live in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md), not
here. Anything a tool can enforce lives in that tool (`crystal tool format`,
`ameba`), not here.

## Goal

Replace one large, always-loaded instruction file with a layered system where
each piece of guidance is delivered by the cheapest mechanism that reliably
triggers it. Guidance should arrive **just-in-time**, scoped to the moment it
applies, instead of being front-loaded and forgotten.

## Scope: complements enforcement, does not replace it

This system is not a substitute for linters, formatters, type checkers, or CI.
Anything those tools can enforce deterministically belongs in them, not in
convention docs. This structure exists for guidance that is hard to enforce
mechanically — judgment calls, trade-offs, directional practices, workflow
knowledge.

A convention doc can also serve as an **incubator**: a practice starts here as
prose, and once it is well understood and its violations are recognizable, it
graduates into a lint rule, formatter setting, or generator, and the prose is
deleted. Movement is one-directional — from docs into tooling, never the reverse.

## The four layers

Every convention, instruction, or practice is classified into exactly one layer.

| Layer | For | Trigger | Delivered by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Root file | Universal rules | Always loaded | `AGENTS.md` |
| 2 Path-scoped | Guidance for a directory / file type | File **path** | PreToolUse hook |
| 3 Construct-scoped | Guidance for an API / code construct | Written **content** (regex), optionally AND path | PostToolUse hook |
| 4 Intent skills | Task-nature guidance (semantic) | Claude Code skill match | Generated `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |

**Layer 1 — root file** (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` symlinked to it). Contains only
a short project description, exact build/test/lint commands, universal rules that
apply to every task, and a one-line map to `docs/conventions/`. Hard budget: keep
well under 150 lines. Every line must pass "would removing this cause a mistake on
a typical task?" Imperative voice; pair every prohibition with the alternative
("Never X; do Y instead"). No style rules a formatter enforces.

**Layers 2 & 3 — path- and construct-scoped rules.** One markdown file per concern
in `docs/conventions/`. Layer 2 declares the `paths:` it applies to; Layer 3
declares the `contents:` regex (optionally AND `paths:` to restrict where a
content match counts — e.g. flag `update_all` only in `app/**`, not one-off
scripts). Where a lint rule could detect the construct but the right response
needs judgment, an advisory (warn-level) lint rule whose message points to the
rule file is preferred over prose alone.

**Layer 4 — intent skills.** For guidance triggered by the nature of a task, not
its path or content ("doing a data migration", "touching billing"). The doc lives
in `docs/conventions/workflows/` and opts in via `skill: true` + a `description:`
starting with "Use when…". Skills are **generated, not hand-written**: `apropos
generate` emits a thin `.claude/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` wrapper (description +
pointer to the source doc). Never edit a wrapper — edit the source doc. Keep skill
docs under 500 lines; split large workflows. Semantic triggering has a miss rate,
so anything that *must* always apply cannot live only here.

## Frontmatter

Each rule doc declares how it is delivered via YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
paths: ["src/**"]              # Layer 2: inject when editing a matching path
contents: ['\bSTDIN\b']        # Layer 3: inject when written code matches (PCRE2)
skill: true                    # Layer 4: generate a skill wrapper
description: "Use when ..."    # required iff skill: true; must start with "Use when"
---
```

Combination semantics:

- `paths` only → Layer 2 (fires on any edit to a matching path)
- `contents` only → Layer 3 (fires when written code matches, anywhere)
- `paths` + `contents` → **AND** (path-scoped Layer 3)
- `skill: true` is independent and may combine with either
- no frontmatter → reference-only: reachable by link, never triggered

## Writing a rule

- One concern per file. Keep it as short as possible — injected rules that are
  tight get read; long ones get skimmed.
- State **what** the rule is, **why** it exists (the reason is how an agent
  generalizes to edge cases), and a **verification criterion**.
- Add an optional `## Verify` heading; `apropos review` harvests it as a review
  checklist item.

## Classifying an instruction

For each instruction, ask in order — the most deterministic trigger wins
(tooling > path > content > intent > always-loaded):

1. **Can tooling enforce it** (formatter, linter, type checker, blocking hook)? →
   Move it to tooling; delete the prose.
2. **Is it universal** — every task in the repo? → Layer 1, subject to the budget.
3. **Determined by file location?** → Layer 2 path-scoped rule.
4. **Determined by a code construct or API usage?** → Layer 3 construct-scoped
   rule (plus an advisory lint rule if detection is feasible).
5. **Determined only by task intent?** → Layer 4 skill.
6. **None of the above / stale / describes the project as it used to be?** → Delete.

## The generation pipeline and review

`apropos generate` walks `docs/conventions/` and compiles the frontmatter into a
cached **trigger index** (`.cache/apropos/index.json`, gitignored, rebuilt only
when a doc's hash changes) and the committed **skill wrappers**. `apropos generate
--check` is the CI gate: it fails if the committed wrappers drift from what the
current docs produce, so a stale or hand-edited `SKILL.md` blocks the merge.

The same frontmatter doubles as a **review manifest**: `apropos review` resolves
which conventions apply to a diff exactly as the edit-time hooks do — path-match
Layer 2, content-match Layer 3 against added lines — and turns each rule's
`## Verify` criterion into a review checklist item. Review prompts therefore carry
zero copies of the conventions; one source serves authoring, editing, and review.

## Quality bar

- Root file under budget, containing zero rules that tooling enforces.
- Every rule file: one concern, as short as possible, with the *why* and a
  verification criterion.
- Every Layer 2/3 file declares at least one path or content trigger.
- Every skill description passes the "Use when…" precision test; all `SKILL.md`
  files are generator output, never hand-edited, with no guidance duplicated from
  `docs/conventions/`.
- `apropos generate --check` and `apropos lint` pass; nothing is silently dropped.

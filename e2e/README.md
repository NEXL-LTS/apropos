# agent-apropos end-to-end test

A [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) suite that runs agent-apropos
against live Claude Code, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot CLI by default (Gemini
CLI is supported but opt-in — see [Options](#options) — since even a healthy
call has been observed taking 30-60s, and a real edit-task prompt over 180s)
and asserts what the model actually writes. It is organized **by layer**;
each layer runs the same with-agent-apropos / without-agent-apropos contrast for
every enabled CLI.

## Structure

```
tests/
  helpers.bash  # sample scaffolding, agent-apropos-on-PATH, agent registry, live runners
  layers.bats   # all layers, each grouped with its expected artifact/prompt/target
```

`layers.bats` holds every layer's expected artifact, prompt, target file, and
the `register_live_tests` call that generates its tests — grouped together so
a layer's full intent reads in one place instead of hopping between files.
Each layer registers a with/without pair of live tests **per CLI agent** in
`E2E_AGENTS` (`helpers.bash`); adding a new CLI agent means adding one entry
to that registry plus a `require_live_<x>`/`run_<x>` helper pair, not a new
per-layer test.

[`project/`](./project) is a sample codebase with a convention document on
every layer. Each convention is a realistic project rule — a tracing
decorator, a custom exception, a registry call, an audit wrapper — naming a
specific module/symbol that only exists because the rule said so. A model
can't produce it by chance, but unlike an arbitrary marker token it's not
inert either: a pass proves the convention's *behavior* landed, not just that
a string got copied. The layers sit on non-overlapping paths so each expected
artifact is attributable to exactly one convention.

The rule docs themselves live in [`conventions/`](./conventions), a sibling
of `project/` — outside the sample's own git repo entirely, pointed at via
`project/agent-apropos.yml`'s `conventions_dir`. That's not incidental: a CLI
agent's own auto-included directory/file listing of its workspace can only
ever show what's inside the workspace, so if the docs lived under
`project/` a sufficiently curious model could discover them (and the fact
that it's being tested) by exploring its own file tree — regardless of
whether agent-apropos's hooks are wired at all. Keeping them external means the
*only* channel that can deliver a rule's content into a live run is agent-apropos's
hooks. `new_sample()` (`tests/helpers.bash`) points the copied sample's
`agent-apropos.yml` at the real `conventions/` for "with" and at a directory that
doesn't exist for "without" — Layer 2/3 then simply have nothing to match,
and there's nothing to find by exploring either. The module each rule points
to (the decorator, exception, registry, audit wrapper) is still stripped
from `project/` in the without-agent-apropos control, since that one *is* reachable
by exploring the sample's own tree.

| Layer | Trigger | Convention | Expected artifact | Target file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 Path-scoped | editing `src/**` | new functions wrapped in `@trace_call` | `@trace_call` | `src/util.py` |
| 3 Construct-scoped | writing `NotImplementedError` | stubs raise `StubNotImplemented` instead | `StubNotImplemented(` | `scripts/jobs.py` |
| 3 Path+content (AND) | editing `db/**` AND writing `conn.execute(` | queries go through the audit wrapper | `audited_query(` | `db/queries.py` |
| 4 Intent skill | "add an arithmetic operation" | new ops register in the dispatch table | `register_operation(` | `lib/calc.py` |

## Running

```sh
make e2e          # or: bash e2e/run.sh
```

**Authenticate with each CLI first.** The live tests need a working, logged-in
`claude`, `opencode`, `gemini`, and `copilot` — see [CI-safety and credentials](#ci-safety-and-credentials)
below for how. Skip this and the corresponding live tests don't fail; they
just skip cleanly, which can look like a pass at a glance.

`bats` and its `bats-support`/`bats-assert` libraries ship in the devcontainer
image (resolved via `BATS_LIB_PATH`), so nothing is fetched at run time.
Before invoking `bats`, `run.sh` runs `agent-apropos init --tool claude --tool
opencode --tool gemini --tool copilot` and `agent-apropos generate` against `project/`
itself, so its hook wiring (`.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/hooks/`)
is always freshly generated rather than committed (see `project/.gitignore`) —
that way the fixture is fully wired regardless of which agents happen to be
installed on the machine running the suite. `run.sh` invokes `bats` on
[`tests/`](./tests); extra flags pass through, e.g. `bash e2e/run.sh --filter 'Layer 2'`.

## The two tests per layer, per agent

Each test copies the sample into an isolated temp git repo (bats'
`BATS_TEST_TMPDIR`, outside this repo) with a freshly built `agent-apropos` on PATH.
For each layer, every agent in `E2E_AGENTS` runs the same live pair:

1. **with agent-apropos (live).** Run the CLI against the wired sample and assert the
   expected artifact lands in the edited file.
2. **without agent-apropos (live control).** Run the same prompt with agent-apropos removed
   and assert the expected artifact does **not** appear.

Deterministic delivery — that a hook payload maps to the right rule, or that
`generate` writes the right skill wrapper — is covered by the Crystal spec
suite (`spec/agent_apropos/hook_spec.cr`, `spec/integration/hook_spec.cr`,
`spec/agent_apropos/generate_spec.cr`, `spec/integration/generate_spec.cr`), not
here. This suite only exists to prove a real CLI agent's own output is
actually steered.

## CI-safety and credentials

The live checks require the `claude` / `opencode` / `gemini` / `copilot` CLI
and valid credentials. When one is absent or unauthenticated, its tests
**skip cleanly** and the run still exits `0`; the deterministic checks always
run. This is why the e2e is not wired into `make check` or CI — it is a
local, opt-in confidence check.

In the devcontainer, Claude's credentials arrive via the `${HOME}/.claude.json`
bind mount. OpenCode's credential lives in a named volume (`opencode-data`), so
authenticate once per container:

```sh
opencode auth login
```

It then persists across rebuilds. Until you do, the live OpenCode tests skip.

Gemini CLI (opt-in — see below) keeps its OAuth credential under `~/.gemini`,
bind-mounted as the `gemini-data` volume — run `gemini` once in the container
and complete its browser OAuth flow on first prompt; it then persists across
rebuilds the same way.

GitHub Copilot CLI keeps its credential under `~/.copilot` — run `copilot`
once and complete `/login`. A stray `GH_TOKEN` in the environment (common in
devcontainers/CI, exported for other tooling) shadows that stored credential
and makes every call fail authentication even when `copilot` itself is
logged in; `run_copilot`/`require_live_copilot` (`helpers.bash`) already
unset it for every invocation they make, so this is only a concern if you
invoke `copilot` yourself outside the suite to debug.

**Copilot CLI caveat:** its own `preToolUse` event can't inject context (only
`postToolUse` can), so its Layer 2 lands right after the edit rather than
before it — see the root README's Supported CLI agents section. More
importantly, **Layer 4 is not implemented for Copilot** (agent-apropos has no
skill-delivery mechanism for it yet): the "Layer 4 ... (Copilot)" pair still
runs, but its "with" pass is a false positive, confirmed by disabling
`.github/hooks` entirely and observing Copilot still produce the expected
artifact purely by exploring the sample's tree on its own. Don't treat that
one pair as evidence of anything until real Copilot skill delivery exists.

## Options

- `E2E_GEMINI=1` — include Gemini CLI in the live matrix. Off by default:
  even a healthy round trip has been observed taking 30-60s for a bare
  no-tool-use prompt and well over 180s for a real edit-task prompt, which
  makes default e2e runs slow and unpredictable. `require_live_gemini`/
  `run_gemini` (`helpers.bash`) remain fully working — set this when you
  deliberately want Gemini coverage.
- `E2E_MODEL=<model>` — pass a specific model to `claude -p --model` /
  `opencode run --model` / `gemini -p --model` / `copilot -p --model`
  (default: each CLI's configured model). Use a small model (e.g.
  `E2E_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5`) for cheaper runs.
- `bash e2e/run.sh --no-tempdir-cleanup` — keep the per-test temp dirs for
  inspection.

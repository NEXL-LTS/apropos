# agent-apropos end-to-end test runner.
#
# Runs the layered bats suite in e2e/tests/. It proves, per layer, that agent-apropos
# delivers its convention and steers a real CLI agent run — see e2e/README.md.
#
# `bats` and the bats-support/bats-assert libraries are provided by the
# devcontainer image (.devcontainer/Dockerfile); BATS_LIB_PATH points at them.
#
# Usage:
#   bash e2e/run.sh                        # run the whole suite
#   bash e2e/run.sh --filter 'Layer 2'     # extra flags pass through to bats
#
# Live checks skip cleanly when a given CLI agent is unavailable, so this is
# safe to run anywhere the image provides bats.

# e2e/project/.claude, .opencode, .gemini, .github/hooks, and CLAUDE.md are
# generated, not committed (see its .gitignore) — regenerate them here so the
# fixture is always wired for every agent before bats copies it per test,
# regardless of whether this machine has claude/opencode/gemini/copilot
# installed (helpers.bash's require_live_<x> is what decides whether the
# *live* tests run; the wiring itself must exist either way). `--tool` is
# used explicitly rather than left to auto-detect for exactly that reason.
# `--claude-symlink` matters here: unlike OpenCode, Gemini, and Copilot CLI,
# Claude Code does not fall back to AGENTS.md when no CLAUDE.md is reachable
# anywhere in the directory hierarchy, so without the symlink the live Claude
# tests would run with zero Layer 1 context. All commands are idempotent.
